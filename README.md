### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a French and British Backend Developper/DevOps.

I'm currently working for Orange Cyberdefense as a DevOps on the Datalake project, a Threat Intelligence SaaS. I'm also a student in security and cloud, two fields I'm passionate about.

Lately I've been enjoying coding in Rust and Golang.
